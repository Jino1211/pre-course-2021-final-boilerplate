my to-do list 

In "my to-do list" I tried to do things simple and clear for the user on the one hand, but still be functional and useful on the other.

I also added some exta functions like those:

* 'Clear the board' - button that restore all the tasks.

* Create 'js' file 'main.test.js' to test the restore option.

* 'Undo' - that can restore the last delete every click.

* 'Oldest/newest' - sort the board from the newest to oldest tasks and opposite.

* 'Search' - that can find and remark the tasks with the insert input.

* All the tasks and the updates save on JSONBIN.IO.

* Delete button for each task.

* Sure option after click delete, for make sure.

* Edit button for each task.

* Loading spinner when you oppen the browser and wait for 'GET' request from JSONBIN.

* Check box for task that finished
