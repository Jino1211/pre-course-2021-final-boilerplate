my to-do list 

In "my to-do list" I tried to do things simple and clear for the user on the one hand, but still functional and useful on the other.

I also added some exta function like those:

* 'clear the board' button that restore all the task.

* create js file 'main.test.js' to test the restore option.

* 'undo' that can restore the last delete evry click.

* 'oldest/newes' sort the board from the newes to oldest tasks and oposite.

*'search' that can find and remark the tasks with the insert input.

* all the task and the update changes save on JSONBIN.IO.

* delete button for each task.

* sure option after click delete, for make sure.

* edit button for each task.

* loading spinner when you oppen the browser and wait for 'GET' requestfrom JSONBIN.

* check box for task that finished
